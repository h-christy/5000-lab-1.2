> Propagandists of today are not like those of yesterday. They are educated, well-equipped, and thoroughly trained specialists, particularly in the western countries, where there are trained corps specializing in every ideology, clarifying its abstruse points, displaying its good features, and inventing means of dissemination and methods of propagandizing for it. On its behalf, they feel out the easiest, most effortless, and most convenient ways to influence the minds of people, leading to inner conviction and conversion. ---- Hasan al-Banna^[Hasan al-Banna, and Charles Wendell., *Five Tracts of Hasan Al-Banna (1906-1949)* Berkeley: University of California Press, 1978]

### Fun Facts
Fibonacci^[Leonardo Fibonacci (1175~1250)]
Thm: $\sum_{i=0}^n F_i=F_{n+2}-1$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$
$$
\begin{aligned} \sum_{i=0}^{k+1} F_i & =\left(\sum_{i=0}^k F_i\right)+F_{k+1} \\ & =F_{k+2}-1+F_{k+1} \\ & =F_{k+3}-1\end{aligned}
